Note that any tickets that are sent to **support@mennotech.ca** will be marked "Medium" by default. In order to escalate the ticket, the end user must prefix the subject of the email with “URGENT” or “HIGH” to notify the technician of the severity of the incident.  

If the response time fails to meet the above requirements, a discount will be applied at the end of the month in which the failure occurred. The discount will be calculated at $80 for each hour the targeted support commitment is missed. The maximum discount in a given month will not exceed 50% of the total invoice amount for the service.
